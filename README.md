# UFO-sightings
## Project Overview
In this project, I have created a table using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS from a list of dictionaries of UFO sigthing data across the world that will allow users to search through the table for specific information. 
In the UFO-level-1, the JavaScript code  will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.
In the UFO-level-1, Using multiple input tags and/or select dropdowns, the JavaScript code lets the user set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:
date/time
city
state
country
shape
